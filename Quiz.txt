1.
Welcome to the first part of the Accessibility Quiz. As you are becoming a seasoned HTML and CSS developer, we have started you off with the basic boilerplate.
Start this accessibility journey by providing a lang attribute to your html element. This will assist screen readers in identifying the language of the page.
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>

2.
You may be familiar with the meta element already; it is used to specify information about the page, such as the title, description, keywords, and author.
Give your page a meta element with an appropriate charset value.
The charset attribute specifies the character encoding of the page, and, nowadays, UTF-8 is the only encoding supported by most browsers.
<meta charset="utf-8">

3.
Continuing with the meta elements, a viewport definition tells the browser how to render the page. Including one betters visual accessibility on mobile, and improves SEO (search engine optimization).
Add a viewport definition with a content attribute detailing the width and initial-scale of the page.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

4.
Another important meta element for accessibility and SEO is the description definition. The value of the content attribute is used by search engines to provide a description of your page.
Add a meta element with the name attribute set to description, and give it a useful content attribute.
<meta name="description" content="freeCodeCamp Accessibility Quiz practice project" />

5.
Lastly in the head, the title element is useful for screen readers to understand the content of a page. Furthermore, it is an important part of SEO.
Give your page a title that is descriptive and concise.
<title>Accessibility Quiz</title>

6.
Navigation is a core part of accessibility, and screen readers rely on you to provide the structure of your page. This is accomplished with semantic HTML elements.
Add a header and a main element to your page.
The header element will be used to introduce the page, as well as provide a navigation menu.
The main element will contain the core content of your page.
<header></header>
    <main></main>

7.
Within the header, provide context about the page by nesting one img, h1, and nav element.
The img should point to https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_primary.svg, have an id of logo, and have an alt text of freeCodeCamp.
The h1 should contain the text HTML/CSS Quiz.
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/platform/universal/fcc_primary.svg" id="logo" alt="freeCodeCamp">
<h1>HTML/CSS Quiz</h1>
<nav></nav>

8.
A useful property of an SVG (scalable vector graphics) is that it contains a path attribute which allows the image to be scaled without affecting the resolution of the resultant image.
Currently, the img is assuming its default size, which is too large. CSS has a max function which returns the largest of a set of comma-separated values. For example: img { width: max(250px, 25vw); }
In the above example, the width of the image will be 250px if the viewport width is less than 1000 pixels. If the viewport width is greater than 1000 pixels, the width of the image will be 25vw. This is because 25vw is equal to 25% of the viewport width.
Scale the image using its id as a selector, and setting the width to be the maximum of 10rem or 18vw.
#logo {
  width: max(10rem, 18vw);
}

9.
As described in the freeCodeCamp Style Guide, the logo should retain an aspect ratio of 35 / 4, and have padding around the text.
First, change the background-color to #0a0a23 so you can see the logo. Then, use the aspect-ratio property to set the desired aspect ratio to 35 / 4. Finally, add a padding of 0.4rem all around.
#logo {
  width: max(10rem, 18vw);
  background-color: #0a0a23;
  aspect-ratio: 35/4;
  padding: 0.4rem;
}

10.
Make the header take up the full width of its parent container, set its height to 50px, and set the background-color to #1b1b32. Then, set the display to use Flexbox.
header {
  width: 100%;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: #1b1b32;
  display: flex;
}

11.
Change the h1 font color to #f1be32, and set the font size to min(5vw, 1.2em).
h1 {
  color: #f1be32;
  font-size: min(5vw, 1.2em);
}

12.
To enable navigation on the page, add an unordered list with the following three list items: INFO, HTML, CSS
The list items text should be wrapped in anchor tags.
<ul>
          <li><a>INFO</a></li>
          <li><a>HTML</a></li>
          <li><a>CSS</a></li>
        </ul>

13.
The child combinator selector > is used between selectors to target only elements that match the second selector and are a direct child of the first selector.
This can be helpful when you have deeply nested elements and want to control the scope of your styling.
Use the > selector to target the unordered list elements within the nav elements, and use Flexbox to evenly space the children.
nav > ul {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}

14.
As this is a quiz, you will need a form for users to submit answers. You can semantically separate the content within the form using section elements.
Within the main element, create a form with three nested section elements. Then, make the form submit to https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz, using the correct method.
<form action="https://freecodecamp.org/practice-project/accessibility-quiz" method="post">
        <section></section>
        <section></section>
        <section></section>
      </form>

15.
To increase the page accessibility, the role attribute can be used to indicate the purpose behind an element on the page to assistive technologies. The role attribute is a part of the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), and accepts preset values.
Give each of the section elements the region role.
<section role="region"></section>
        <section role="region"></section>
        <section role="region"></section>

16.
Every region role requires a label, which helps screen reader users understand the purpose of the region. One method for adding a label is to add a heading element inside the region and then reference it with the aria-labelledby attribute.
Add the following aria-labelledby attributes to the section elements: student-info, html-questions, css-questions
Then, within each section element, nest one h2 element with an id matching the corresponding aria-labelledby attribute. Give each h2 suitable text content.
<section role="region" aria-labelledby="student-info">
          <h2 id="student-info">Student Info</h2>
        </section>
        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="html-questions">
          <h2 id="html-questions">HTML Questions</h2>
        </section>
        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="css-questions">
          <h2 id="css-questions">CSS Questions</h2>
        </section>

17.
Typeface plays an important role in the accessibility of a page. Some fonts are easier to read than others, and this is especially true on low-resolution screens.
Change the font for both the h1 and h2 elements to Verdana, and use another web-safe font in the sans-serif family as a fallback.
Also, add a border-bottom of 4px solid #dfdfe2 to h2 elements to make the sections distinct.
h1, h2 {
  font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;
}

h2 {
  border-bottom: 4px solid #dfdfe2;
}

18.
To be able to navigate within the page, give each anchor element an href corresponding to the id of the h2 elements.
<li><a href="#student-info">INFO</a></li>
          <li><a href="#html-questions">HTML</a></li>
          <li><a href="#css-questions">CSS</a></li>

19.
Filling out the content of the quiz, below #student-info, add three div elements with a class of info.
Then, within each div nest one label element, and one input element.
<div class="info">
            <label></label>
            <input>
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            <label></label>
            <input>
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            <label></label>
            <input>
          </div>

20.
It is important to link each input to the corresponding label element. This provides assistive technology users with a visual reference to the input.
This is done by giving the label a for attribute, which contains the id of the input.
This section will take a student's name, email address, and date of birth. Give the label elements appropriate for attributes, as well as text content. Then, link the input elements to the corresponding label elements.
<div class="info">
            <label for="student-name">Name:</label>
            <input id="student-name" />
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            <label for="student-email">Email:</label>
            <input id="student-email" />
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            <label for="birth-date">Date of Birth:</label>
            <input id="birth-date" />
          </div>

21.
Keeping in mind best-practices for form inputs, give each input an appropriate type and name attribute. Then, give the first input a placeholder attribute.
<div class="info">
            <label for="student-name">Name:</label>
            <input type="text" name="student-name" id="student-name" placeholder="e.g. Quincy Larson" />
          </div>
<div class="info">
            <label for="student-email">Email:</label>
            <input type="email" name="student-email" id="student-email" />
          </div>
          <div class="info">
            <label for="birth-date">Date of Birth:</label>
            <input type="date" name="birth-date" id="birth-date" />
          </div>

22.
Even though you added a placeholder to the first input element in the previous lesson, this is actually not a best-practice for accessibility; too often, users confuse the placeholder text with an actual input value - they think there is already a value in the input.
Remove the placeholder text from the first input element, relying on the label being the best-practice.
<input type="text" name="student-name" id="student-name"/>

23.
Within the second section element, add two div elements with a class of question-block.
Then, within each div.question-block element, add one h3 element with text of incrementing numbers, starting at 1, and one fieldset element with a class of question.
<div class="question-block">
            <h3>1</h3>
            <fieldset class="question"></fieldset>
          </div>
          <div class="question-block">
            <h3>2</h3>
            <fieldset class="question"></fieldset>
          </div>

24.
The question numbers are not descriptive enough. This is especially true for visually impaired users. One way to get around such an issue, without having to add visible text to the element, is to add text only a screen reader can read.
Append a span element with a class of sr-only to each of the h3 elements.
<h3><span class="sr-only">1</span></h3>
            <fieldset class="question"></fieldset>
          </div>
          <div class="question-block">
            <h3><span class="sr-only">2</span></h3>

25.
Within the first span element, add the text Question.
In the second span element, add the text Question.
<h3><span class="sr-only">Question</span>1</h3>
            <fieldset class="question"></fieldset>
          </div>
          <div class="question-block">
            <h3><span class="sr-only">Question</span>2</h3>

26.
The .sr-only text is still visible. There is a common pattern to visually hide text for only screen readers to read.
This pattern is to set the following CSS properties:
position: absolute;
width: 1px;
height: 1px;
padding: 0;
margin: -1px;
overflow: hidden;
clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
white-space: nowrap;
border: 0;

.sr-only {
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
  height: 1px;
  padding: 0;
  margin: -1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  white-space: nowrap;
  border: 0;
}

27.
Each fieldset will contain a true/false question.
Within each fieldset, nest one legend element, and one ul element with two options.
<legend></legend>
              <ul>
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
              </ul>

28.
Give each fieldset an adequate name attribute. Then, give both unordered lists a class of answers-list.
Finally, use the legend to caption the content of the fieldset by placing a true/false question as the text content.
<fieldset class="question" name="html-question-one">
              <legend>
                The legend element represents a caption for the content of its
                parent fieldset element
              </legend>
              <ul class="answers-list">
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
              </ul>
            </fieldset>
          </div>
          <div class="question-block">
            <h3><span class="sr-only">Question</span>2</h3>
            <fieldset class="question" name="html-question-two">
              <legend>
                A label element nesting an input element is required to have a
                for attribute with the same value as the input's id
              </legend>
              <ul class="answers-list">
                <li></li>
                <li></li>
              </ul>
            </fieldset>

29.
To provide the functionality of the true/false questions, we need a set of inputs which do not allow both to be selected at the same time.
Within each list element, nest one label element, and within each label element, nest one input element with the appropriate type.
<label><input type="radio"></label>

30.
Add an id to all of your radio inputs so you can link your labels to them. Give the first one an id of q1-a1. Give the rest of them ids of q1-a2, q2-a1, and q2-a2, respectively.
<input type="radio" id="q2-a2"/>

31.
Although not required for label elements with a nested input, it is still best-practice to explicitly link a label with its corresponding input element.
Now, add a for attribute to each of your four labels that links the label to its corresponding radio input.
<label for="q2-a2">

32.
Give the label elements text such that the input comes before the text. Then, give the input elements a value matching the text.
The text should either be True or False.
<input type="radio" id="q2-a1" value="true"/>
                    True

33.
If you click on the radio inputs, you might notice both inputs within the same true/false fieldset can be selected at the same time.
Group the relevant inputs together such that only one input from a pair can be selected at a time.
<input type="radio" id="q2-a2" value="false" name="html-question-two"/>

34.
To prevent unnecessary repetition, target the before pseudo-element of the h3 element, and give it a content property of "Question #".
h3::before {
  content: "Question #";
}

35.
The final section of this quiz will contain a dropdown, and a text box.
Begin by nesting a div with a class of formrow, and nest four div elements inside of it, alternating their class attributes with question-block and answer.
<div class="formrow">
            <div class="question-block"></div>
            <div class="answer"></div>
            <div class="question-block"></div>
            <div class="answer"></div>
          </div>

36.
Within the div.question-block elements, nest one label element, and add a CSS related question to the label text.
<label>Can the CSS margin property accept negative values?</label>
<label>Do you have any questions:</label>

37.
Within the first div.answer element, nest one required select element with three option elements.
Give the first option element a value of "", and the text Select an option. Give the second option element a value of yes, and the text Yes. Give the third option element a value of no, and the text No.
<select required>
                <option value="">Select an option</option>
                <option value="yes">Yes</option>
                <option value="no">No</option>
              </select>

38.
Link the first label element to the select element, and give the select element a name attribute.
<label for="selector">Can the CSS margin property accept negative values?</label>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <select name="selector" id="selector" required>

39.
Nest one textarea element within the second div.answer element, and set the number of rows and columns it has.
<textarea rows="5" cols="24"></textarea>

40.
As with the other input and label elements, link the textarea to its corresponding label element, and give it a name attribute.
<label for="css-textarea">Do you have any questions:</label>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              <textarea id="css-textarea" name="css-questions" rows="5" cols="24"></textarea>

41.
Do not forget to give your form a submit button with the text Send.
<button type="submit">Send</button>

42.
Two final semantic HTML elements for this project are the footer and address elements. The footer element is a container for a collection of content that is related to the page, and the address element is a container for contact information for the author of the page.
After the main element, add one footer element, and nest one address element within it.
<footer>
  <address>
  </address>
</footer>

43.
Within the address element, add the following: freeCodeCamp<br />
San Francisco<br />
California<br />
USA
The br tags will allow each part of the address to be on its own line and are useful for presenting address elements properly.
<footer>
      <address>
        freeCodeCamp<br />
        San Francisco<br />
        California<br />
        USA
      </address>
    </footer>

44.
The address element does not have to contain a physical geographical location. It can be used to provide a link to the subject.
Wrap a link around the text freeCodeCamp, and set its location to https://freecodecamp.org.
<a href="https://freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp</a><br />

45.
Back to styling the page. Select the list elements within the navigation bar, and give them the following styles: color: #dfdfe2;
margin: 0 0.2rem;
padding: 0.2rem;
display: block;

nav > ul > li {
  color: #dfdfe2;
  margin: 0 0.2rem;
  padding: 0.2rem;
  display: block;
}

46.
On the topic of visual accessibility, contrast between elements is a key factor. For example, the contrast between the text and the background of a heading should be at least 4.5:1.
Change the font color of all the anchor elements within the list elements to something with a contrast ratio of at least 7:1.
li > a {
  color: inherit;
}

47.
To make the navigation buttons look more like typical buttons, remove the underline from the anchor tags.
Then, create a new selector targeting the navigation list elements so that when the cursor hovers over them, the background color and text color are switched, and the cursor becomes a pointer.
nav > ul > li:hover {
  background-color: #dfdfe2;
  color: #1b1b32;
  cursor: pointer;
}

48.
Tidy up the header, by using Flexbox to put space between the children, and vertically center them.
Then, fix the header to the top of the viewport.
header {
  width: 100%;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: #1b1b32;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
}

49.
When the screen width is small, the h1 does not wrap its text content how it should. Align the text for the h1 element in the center.
Then, give the main padding such that the Student Info section header can be fully seen.
h1 {
  color: #f1be32;
  font-size: min(5vw, 1.2em);
  text-align: center;
}

main {
  padding-top: 50px;
}

50.
On small screens, the unordered list in the navigation bar overflows the right side of the screen.
Fix this by using Flexbox to wrap the ul content. Then, set the following CSS properties to correctly align the text: align-items: center;
padding-inline-start: 0;
margin-block: 0;
height: 100%;

nav > ul {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  align-items: center;
  padding-inline-start: 0;
  margin-block: 0;
  height: 100%;
}

51.
Set the width of the section elements to 80% of their parent container. Then, use margins to center the section elements, adding 10px to the bottom margin.
Also, ensure the section elements cannot be larger than 600px in width.
section {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
  max-width: 600px;
}

52.
Replace the top margin of the h2 elements with 60px of top padding.
h2 {
  border-bottom: 4px solid #dfdfe2;
  margin-top: 0;
  padding-top: 60px;
}

53.
Add padding to the top and left of the .info elements, and set the other values to 0.
.info {
  padding: 10px 0 0 5px;
}

54.
Give the .formrow elements top margin, and left and right padding. The other padding values should be 0.
Then, increase the font size for all input elements.
.formrow {
  margin-top: 30px;
  padding: 0px 15px;
}

input {
  font-size: 1rem;
}

55.
To make the first section look more inline, target only the input elements within .info elements, and set their width to 50%, and left-align their text.
.info input {
  width: 50%;
  text-align: left;
}

56.
Target all label elements within .info elements, and set their width to 10%, and make it so they do not take up less than 55px.
.info label {
  width: 10%;
  min-width: 55px;
}

57.
To align the input boxes with each other, create a new ruleset that targets all input and label elements within an .info element and set the display property to inline-block.
Also, align the label element's text to the right.
.info label, .info input {
  display: inline-block;
}

.info label {
  width: 10%;
  min-width: 55px;
  text-align: right;
}

58.
To neaten the .question-block elements, set the following CSS properties: text-align: left;
display: block;
width: 100%;
margin-top: 20px;
padding-top: 5px;

.question-block {
  text-align: left;
  display: block;
  width: 100%;
  margin-top: 20px;
  padding-top: 5px;
}

59.
Make the h3 elements appear as a higher priority, with the following CSS properties: margin-top: 5px;
padding-left: 15px;
font-size: 1.375rem;

h3 {
  margin-top: 5px;
  padding-left: 15px;
  font-size: 1.375rem;
}

60.
It is useful to see the default border around the fieldset elements, during development. However, it might not be the style you want.
Remove the border and bottom padding on the .question elements.
.question {
  border: none;
  padding-bottom: 0;
}

61.
While ul/li elements are great at providing bullets for list items, your radio buttons don't need them. You can control what the bullets look with the list-style property. For example you can turn your bullets into circles with the following: ul {
  list-style: circle;
}
Remove the default styling for the .answers-list items by setting its style to none, and remove the unordered list padding.
.answers-list {
    list-style: none;
    padding: 0;
  }

62.
Give the submit button a freeCodeCamp-style design, with the following CSS properties: display: block;
margin: 40px auto;
width: 40%;
padding: 15px;
font-size: 1.438rem;
background: #d0d0d5;
border: 3px solid #3b3b4f;

button {
  display: block;
  margin: 40px auto;
  width: 40%;
  padding: 15px;
  font-size: 1.438rem;
  background: #d0d0d5;
  border: 3px solid #3b3b4f;
}

63.
